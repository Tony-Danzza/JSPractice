// Coercion is when you force something that is of a different type, such as a string or number, or an object or anything like that and force it into another type. For example when we coerce something into a true boolean.


// To explicitly convert its return value (or any expression in general) to the corresponding boolean value, use a double NOT operator (!!) or the Boolean constructor.
